### Hi there üëã

üë®‚Äçüíª Senior Product Developer | üöÄ ML Engineering Pro | ‚òÅÔ∏è Certified Azure Practitioner

üíº Driven by a love for creation and a dedication to mission-driven goals, I specialise in rapid prototyping and productizing AI-enabled software. As a Senior Product Developer focused on machine learning, I work closely with stakeholders to develop impactful ML/AI models and quickly move prototypes to production. Passionate about innovation, I strive to make substantial contributions to dynamic and evolving teams.

üåü Here on GitHub, I share projects that I explore in my free time, separate from my professional work. This is my playground for experimentation, learning, and connecting with others.
